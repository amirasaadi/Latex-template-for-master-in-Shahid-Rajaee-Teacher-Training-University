	abstract = {Measuring cognitive load changes can contribute to better treatment of patients, can help design effective strategies to reduce medical errors among clinicians and can facilitate user evaluation of health care information systems. This paper proposes an eye-based automatic cognitive load measurement (CLM) system toward realizing these prospects. Three types of eye activity are investigated: pupillary response, blink and eye movement (fixation and saccade). Eye activity features are investigated in the presence of emotion interference, which is a source of undesirable variability, to determine the susceptibility of CLM systems to other factors. Results from an experiment combining arithmetic-based tasks and affective image stimuli demonstrate that arousal effects are dominated by cognitive load during task execution. To minimize the arousal effect on CLM, the choice of segments for eye-based features is examined. We then propose a feature set and classify three levels of cognitive load. The performance of cognitive load level prediction was found to be close to that of a reaction time measure, showing the feasibility of eye activity features for near-real time CLM. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The contents include peer-reviewed chapters based on a selection of papers presented at the 11th European Conference on Eye Movements (Turku, Finland 2001), supplemented by invited contributions. The ECEM conference series brings together researchers from various disciplines with an interest to use eye-tracking to study perceptual and higher order cognitive functions. The contents of the book faithfully reflect the scope and diversity of interest in eye-tracking as a fruitful tool both in basic and applied research. It consists of five sections: visual information processing and saccadic eye movements; empirical studies of reading and language production; computational models of eye movements in reading; eye-tracking as a tool to study human-computer interaction; and eye movement applications in media and communication research. Each section is concluded by a commentary chapter by one of the leading authorities in the field. These commentaries discuss and integrate the contributions in the section and provide an expert view on the most significant present and future developments in the respective areas.},

@article{Krejtz2018,
	abstract = {Pupil diameter and microsaccades are captured by an eye tracker and compared for their suitability as indicators of cognitive load (as beset by task difficulty). Specifically, two metrics are tested in response to task difficulty: (1) the change in pupil diameter with respect to interor intra-trial baseline, and (2) the rate and magnitude of microsaccades. Participants performed easy and difficult mental arithmetic tasks while fixating a central target. Inter-trial change in pupil diameter and microsaccade magnitude appear to adequately discriminate task difficulty, and hence cognitive load, if the implied causality can be assumed. This paper's contribution corroborates previous work concerning microsaccade magnitude and extends this work by directly comparing microsaccade metrics to pupillometric measures. To our knowledge this is the first study to compare the reliability and sensitivity of taskevoked pupillary and microsaccadic measures of cognitive load.},

\section{Conclusion}
In this homework we use synthesis some data to analyses DBSCAN algorithm with different parameters and to measure the quality of our results we use five different evaluation measurement. we design six different case which three of them has different input data and others has different algorithm parameters and one base case to compare them.
\newline
Results shows that if parameters of this algorithm tuned well it can do clustering even data in complex forms while other common and well known method such as k-means fail. on the other hand there is no need to know the number of cluster before the algorithm. also running time of this algorithm relatively is better than others. the implementation is available here\cite{github:HW4}.
